Stuffs that needs attention:

    1.  Figure out static directory - currently working but not final

        Current version:
        STATICFILES_DIRS = (os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '/home/razer/Desktop/project/e-commerce/static'), )

        Should be:
        STATICFILES_DIRS = (os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'home\static'), )

    2. Add the address field in Customer table (if needed)

    3. Add categories page

    4. Need to refresh page everytime while adding product to cart
